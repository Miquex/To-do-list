# To-do-list
Full Stack To-Do List using Django REST Framework (API) and React (Vite) with Tailwind CSS.  Key features include a clean architecture using Custom Hooks (useTasks.js) to abstract API logic and a sophisticated Local Loading State via Callbacks for non-blocking, asynchronous UX on task operations (Delete/Complete). Simple, robust, and scalable.
